Master thesis scripts
==================================

This repository contains the R scripts used to analyse the dataset
and to generate plots.

All scripts require the dataset file `dataset.csv` in the current working
directory.
The dataset can be downloaded from [[1]](https://github.com/bgraf/mt-scripts/releases/download/v0.1/dataset.zip)
